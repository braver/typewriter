# typewriter

### Improves the writing experience in Atom.

* Centered layout
* No gutter
* No scrollbar (unless you hover over the editor)
* Keeps tabs, tree-view, minimap, and etc.
* Enables soft-wrapping for selected scopes
* Enable for all file scopes or for the scopes you select

### Documentation

typewriter uses Atom's `Settings > Editor > Preferred Line Length` setting to set the width of the centered column. 

By default it works for (GF-)Markdown, Latex and MediaWiki files. You can change what file scopes enable the typewriter plugin in the settings or have it enabled for all files scopes.
